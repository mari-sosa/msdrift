This is a franklab fork of the magland msdrift repository from github.

It contains all source code for drift tracking as well as the updated pyms.anneal_segments to anneal clusters across all segments.

We can pull updates from the magland repo using:
> git pull upstream master

Franklab-specific changes will only get pushed to Mari's github fork and this bitbucket repo.
